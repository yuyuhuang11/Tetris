# Tetris

This is a deceptively simple Tetris puzzle game built in Java. Small pieces fall from the top of the grid to the bottom. The pieces are comprised of 4 squares arranged into 7 different patterns. Players must rotate the pieces as they fall and fit them together to complete lines. When the player fills an entire line with blocks, that line is removed from the screen. If the player cannot complete lines, the blocks will eventually fill to the top of the screen and the game ends.

## Implementment Environment
Recommend to run the game under the IDE environment (e.g., [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/)). Otherwise, it will require a makefile to compile the executables and then run the game.
